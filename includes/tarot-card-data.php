                    'general' => "The Fool represents the spirit of new beginnings, limitless potential, and bold adventure. When upright, it symbolizes a willingness to leap into the unknown, trusting in life’s process even when the outcome is uncertain. You are being called to start fresh-with a heart full of hope, not burdened by the past. This card invites you to embrace spontaneity, live freely, and follow your intuition. It’s an ideal time to take risks that align with your passion and curiosity. Whether it’s a new path, project, or mindset, The Fool encourages an open-minded, optimistic approach. Be aware, however, of naivety or careless actions. Though this journey is full of promise, a bit of wisdom will keep you safe along the way. Think of this moment as the universe giving you permission to explore life without fear. Trust in the timing, take that leap, and let your journey unfold with faith and wonder.",

If you’re single, it points to a spontaneous, possibly unexpected connection that awakens your sense of adventure and optimism. This card encourages you to let go of past relationship baggage and embrace what’s ahead with an open heart. For those already in a relationship, The Fool may suggest a renewed spark, a fun trip together, or exploring a new dynamic in your bond. It’s about rediscovering the joy of being in love without overthinking or planning every step. You’re being urged to approach love with trust and curiosity rather than fear or control. However, remember to stay grounded-don’t overlook red flags in the name of freedom. Love is beautiful when it flows naturally, but it still requires honesty and emotional responsibility. The Fool invites you to fall in love with love again, to take a risk on your heart, and to believe in the magic of new emotional adventures.",
                    'money' => "Financially, The Fool brings a sense of opportunity and new ventures. Upright, it often signals a time when a new financial path is opening up-whether that’s an investment, a business idea, or an unconventional income stream. You’re being encouraged to take a calculated leap of faith. Trust your instincts, but do your homework before diving in completely. This card reflects a time when money may flow more freely, or when you may be asked to trust the process despite uncertainties. It’s a great time to break out of scarcity thinking and embrace an abundance mindset. Just beware of spending impulsively or investing in something without clear understanding. While The Fool loves adventure, your finances still need a bit of planning and responsibility. If you’ve been stuck financially, this card is a green light to try something bold and different. Be smart, stay optimistic, and take steps that align with your values and intuition.",

You may be trying out a new wellness routine, shifting your diet, or exploring alternative healing methods. This card brings vibrant, optimistic energy that supports natural healing and self-care. It encourages you to listen to your body, trust your instincts, and not be afraid to explore unconventional paths to health. If you’ve been recovering from illness or emotional stress, The Fool suggests a lightness returning-an opportunity to reclaim vitality and joy. Mental and emotional health also get a boost here; it’s a great time to release limiting beliefs or old patterns. However, don’t ignore medical advice or act recklessly with your health in the name of freedom. The Fool wants you to feel alive and free, but also encourages balance. Take the leap into better health with curiosity, positivity, and a little wisdom guiding your steps.",        
                    'career' => "The Fool in a career reading speaks of new beginnings, bold risks, and untapped potential. This is a powerful time to start a new job, launch a business, or change your career direction entirely. The upright Fool encourages taking chances that align with your passion, even if you’re unsure where they’ll lead. If you’ve been feeling stuck, this card is a cosmic nudge to follow your heart and pursue something more fulfilling. It also reflects a time when creativity and innovation are highly favored-your ideas may be more valuable than you realize. On the flip side, don’t be careless with decisions. While courage is important, reckless moves without a plan could backfire. Stay grounded while remaining open to the magic of possibilities. If you’ve felt fear or hesitation, now’s the time to step forward. The Fool reminds you that every expert was once a beginner. Trust the journey, embrace learning, and move forward with confidence."

It may indicate that you’re leaping into something too soon without adequate preparation or thought. There’s a risk of acting impulsively, ignoring advice, or refusing to acknowledge consequences. This card urges you to pause and consider whether your choices are being driven by genuine inspiration or escapism. You might be avoiding responsibility or failing to see potential dangers ahead. Alternatively, fear of failure may be paralyzing you from taking any step at all. The reversed Fool also points to inner confusion and a lack of direction, making it hard to trust your instincts. Take this as a sign to ground yourself, reevaluate your path, and create a plan. Mistakes are part of growth, but avoidable ones shouldn’t be repeated. Seek clarity, listen to your intuition, and don’t rush. A wise pause now will lead to a better beginning later. Tread carefully-but don’t abandon the dream.",

If you're starting a new relationship, there may be unrealistic expectations, poor boundaries, or a failure to consider long-term compatibility. This card often shows up when someone is pursuing romance for the thrill but lacks emotional depth or responsibility. If you're in a committed relationship, it could suggest one partner isn't taking things seriously or is behaving unpredictably. There may also be trust issues or avoidance of meaningful communication. Alternatively, fear of being hurt may be keeping you from opening your heart. This card urges you to grow emotionally-don’t jump in blindly, but also don’t shut down completely. It's time to reflect on your patterns in love. Are you running away from real connection or rushing into it too quickly? A bit of maturity and emotional clarity will serve you well now. Ground your heart in self-love before taking another step forward.",        
                    'money' => "The Fool reversed in a financial context warns against poor planning, risky investments, or careless spending. You might be tempted to chase unrealistic ventures or ignore red flags when it comes to money. Overspending, gambling, or impulsive financial behavior could lead to setbacks or losses. This card can also indicate missed opportunities due to fear of failure or procrastination. Now is not the time to act on whims without doing proper research. Be cautious of promises that seem too good to be true. Additionally, you might be struggling with budgeting or avoiding financial responsibilities. Take a step back and reassess your relationship with money. Are you being too carefree, or are you paralyzed by indecision? Grounding yourself in financial literacy and seeking sound advice can prevent unnecessary hardship. Avoid shortcuts and instead focus on building stable foundations. This is a time to learn from past mistakes and make wiser choices moving forward.",        
                    'health' => "Health-wise, The Fool reversed points to ignoring warning signs, careless habits, or refusing to take your well-being seriously. You may be engaging in risky behaviors, neglecting medical advice, or jumping from one health trend to another without consistency. This card is a reminder that while optimism is important, denial can be dangerous. You might be downplaying symptoms or assuming things will get better without action. Alternatively, fear of change may be preventing you from starting a healthier routine. There could also be mental or emotional instability due to a lack of structure or support. It’s time to slow down and tune into what your body and mind truly need. Avoid extreme measures and seek a balanced, informed approach to wellness. Don’t wait for a health scare to take things seriously. Reconnect with your inner wisdom, develop healthy routines, and take small, steady steps toward lasting well-being.",        
                    'career' => "The Fool reversed in career highlights confusion, missteps, or a lack of readiness. You may be starting something new without the necessary skills, support, or direction. There’s a risk of rushing into a role or project blindly, leading to avoidable mistakes. This card can also reflect workplace immaturity, unpredictability, or not taking responsibilities seriously. Alternatively, it may represent stagnation due to fear-you might be holding yourself back from pursuing something better out of self-doubt. Whether it’s impulsiveness or hesitation, the reversed Fool asks you to realign. Don’t let pride prevent you from asking for help or mentorship. Avoid risky leaps and focus on developing a clear plan. This is a moment to pause, research, and strategize rather than act on whims. If you've recently faced failure, see it as a learning moment rather than defeat. The journey to career growth often begins by correcting your footing and learning from every stumble."

If you’re single, this is an excellent time to meet someone new-your charm, confidence, and clarity are high, and you may attract a partner who is equally aligned with your energy. You’re encouraged to be bold, take the lead, and express your intentions clearly. If you’re in a relationship, The Magician indicates a time of positive communication, shared goals, and renewed passion. It may also suggest that one partner is stepping up to make the relationship stronger. However, it's important to remain genuine and avoid manipulation.

Now is a great time to start a new health routine, seek holistic therapies, or follow through with treatments you’ve been considering. Your ability to focus and take conscious action will play a big role in your recovery or improvement. This card also emphasizes the mind-body connection-your thoughts, beliefs, and intentions significantly influence your physical state. You may find success through combining conventional medicine with alternative approaches like meditation, energy healing, or herbal remedies. The Magician encourages you to be your own healer-gather information, use your resources wisely, and take full responsibility for your wellness journey.

You may have the tools to succeed, but you’re not using them to their full capacity-or worse, you’re misusing them. This card suggests a disconnect between your intentions and your actions. You might be lacking confidence, scattered in focus, or attempting to control outcomes through dishonest means. It’s important to pause and reflect on whether you’re acting with integrity. Are you being honest with yourself and others? Are you using your gifts for the highest good? The reversed Magician can also point to self-doubt or imposter syndrome-feeling unworthy of success despite your abilities. Alternatively, you may be dealing with someone who is manipulating you or hiding their true motives. This is a warning to reassess your direction and realign with truth.

One or both partners may not be fully honest or may be using charm to hide true intentions. If you're single, be cautious-someone may seem too good to be true or may be playing with your emotions. There could be mind games, false promises, or unclear motives. If you’re in a relationship, this card suggests a need for transparent communication and emotional authenticity. The reversed Magician may also point to insecurity or a power imbalance, where one partner dominates the relationship dynamics. You may be trying too hard to impress or control the situation, rather than letting love flow naturally. Step back and ask yourself: Are you expressing your true feelings, or just playing a role? Are your needs being met honestly? It's time to remove the mask-yours or theirs-and return to a place of truth. Love built on illusion cannot last.",

Alternatively, you may be holding back from acting on an idea due to fear or lack of confidence. It’s important to reassess your relationship with money-are you being strategic and intentional, or impulsive and avoidant? The reversed Magician also warns against deceitful financial behaviors, whether by you or someone else.

You may not be listening to your body, ignoring medical advice, or placing too much faith in quick fixes. There might be confusion around symptoms or a sense of feeling overwhelmed by your options. Alternatively, you could be giving your power away-relying on others for answers instead of trusting your own ability to heal. This card urges you to reconnect with your inner wisdom and take charge of your well-being. Be cautious about self-diagnosing or following advice from unverified sources. It’s a good time to seek a second opinion, do your own research, and create a balanced approach to health. The Magician reversed can also point to low energy, stress, or emotional fatigue. Clear your mind, prioritize self-care, and build healthier routines. With intentional action and renewed focus, you can shift your healing journey in a positive direction.",

This card appears when it’s time to listen more than speak, observe rather than act, and connect with the mysteries of life. It signifies a period of spiritual growth, insight, and heightened awareness. Answers are within you, but they may not be fully visible yet. The High Priestess is the guardian of the subconscious realm-her presence means you should pay attention to dreams, signs, and gut feelings. You may be drawn to spiritual study, meditation, or esoteric teachings. This card encourages patience and stillness rather than external pursuit. Something is unfolding behind the scenes, and it’s not ready to be revealed. Instead of forcing things, let your intuition guide you step by step. There’s power in quiet knowing.

You are being asked to trust your inner feelings and pay attention to non-verbal cues and energetic chemistry. Love may blossom in spiritual spaces or through a soulful connection that feels destined. If you're in a relationship, this card signals a time of emotional reflection and intuitive bonding.

You may be receiving subtle signs about your professional path, or you might be drawn to more intuitive, creative, or spiritual work. It’s a good moment to trust your instincts rather than seeking validation from others. If you're considering a new job or project, hold off until you feel confident internally. Something is developing beneath the surface, and more will be revealed in time. This card can also represent someone around you who holds key knowledge or acts as a spiritual mentor or guide.

If you’ve been feeling burned out or uninspired, taking a quiet pause may reignite your passion. You don’t need to rush decisions now. Instead, go inward, listen to your intuition, and let clarity emerge organically. Mentorship may also play a role-you could be a guide for others, or find guidance from someone older or wiser.
